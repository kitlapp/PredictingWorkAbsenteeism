# Logistic Regression Model for Human Resources Management
It contains a Logistic Regression model developed for human resources management purposes. The workflow begins with data cleaning and scaling, followed by training an initial model. GridSearchCV was employed for hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. The best model and the associated scaler were saved, simulating professional deployment processes. Finally, the trained model and scaler were deployed for making predictions on new, unseen data.

## FILES INCLUDED:
1. Data Files (X 4):
* Original training and testing file (.csv)
* Corresponding cleaned data file (.csv)
* Original and unseen data files for model deployment (.csv)
* Corresponding cleaned files (.csv)
2. Core Jupyter Files (X 4):
* Files named sequentially to indicate the execution order
--> I clear the cell outputs in Jupyter to maintain a clean code appearance. Please follow the instructions below to see how my code is executed.
3. Python file (.py) which contains the custom functions X 1.
4. Deployment files X 2
5. The README File
