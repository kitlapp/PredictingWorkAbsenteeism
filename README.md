# log_reg_absenteeism
The project aims to forecast employee absences using logistic regression, leveraging data preprocessing and feature selection to enhance model accuracy.

This project provided an excellent opportunity to expand my skills in areas I hadn't previously explored. I cleaned and processed the data, developed various logistic regression models, and saved the best-performing model along with its scaler. I then applied the same preprocessing steps to new and unseen data and utilized the saved model and scaler to make predictions, displaying the final results on screen.

This project showcases the practical application of logistic regression in human resource management. Accurate predictions of employee absences enable organizations to effectively distribute resources and implement strategies to reduce absenteeism, boosting productivity and operational efficiency.

1) Original Dataset: Absenteeism_data.csv
2) Original Cleaned Dataset: cleaned_data.csv
3) New Dataset for Model Deployment: Absenteeism_new_data.csv
4) New Dataset for Model Deployment (Cleaned): cleaned_new_data.csv
5) Results of Model Deployment on New Data: test_results.csv
6) Original Dataset Preprocessing: absenteeism_data_cleaning.ipynb
7) Original Dataset Model: absenteeism_model.ipynb
8) New Dataset Preprocessing: abs_new_data_cleaning.ipynb
9) New Dataset Model Deployment: abs_new_data_model_test.ipynb
10) Project Python Scripts: absenteeism_scripts.py

What I gained from this project?
1) Performed detailed data cleaning and feature engineering, including creating new features, one-hot encoding, and generating dummy variables.
2) Applied logistic regression models by converting the target variable into binary form.
3) Saved the model and scaler, and applied them to new, unseen data, simulating real-life data science scenarios.
4) Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
